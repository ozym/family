    PERSONAL

    The late Mr. Caves who died on
    Sunday last at the ripe age of 81
    years came to New Zealand some 62
    years ago, and was for some time en-
    gaged on the work of constructing the
    railway line between Wanganui and
    Patea. He afterwards removed to
    Litchfield, Waikato where he was mar-
    ried. Returning to Taranaki he was
    farming at Hurleyville and later at
    Kakaramea, where he resided up to the
    time of his death. He was for some
    years a director of the Kakaramea Co-
    Operative Dairy Company. Mr.
    Cave's wife predeceased him 17 years
    ago. He leaves a family of two
    sons, Messrs Archibald and William
    Caves of Kakaramea, and two daugh-
    ters, Mrs. H. L, Chadwick (Hawera)
    and Mrs. P. Tong (Manaiii). There
    are 15 grandchildren and [14] great
    grandchildren. The funeral took
    place at the Patea Cemetery yester-
    day afternoon.

    BREACH OF THE LICEN-
         SING ACT.

    WHEN IS A MAN INTOXICATED?

    A PUBLICAN FINED

    In the S.M. Court on Friday, before
    Mr Turnbull, S M., J. Grayden,
    licensee of the Kakaramea Hotel,
    was charged with selling alcoholic liquor
    to John Caves, a person already in a
    state of intoxication. Mr H. 0. Clarke
    appeared for the defendant who
    pleaded not guilty, whilst Constable
    O’Brien conducted the case for the
    prosecution.
    
    Constable O’Brien stated the facts
    were that John Caves came from the
    hotel drunk and assaulted his wife.
    The neighbours interfered. Caves
    then returned to the hotel where the
    wife of the licensee supplied him with
    more liquor. A neighbor, Mr Forbes,
    followed him. When Mr Forbes re-
    monstrated that the man was drunk he
    was told “that Caves was not very
    drunk,” and the liquor was given him.
    A. N. Forbes, on oath, deposed he

    was a dairy farmer at Kakaramea.
    On 8th March he saw John Caves, who
    was drunk. He was passing the
    house when Mrs Caves came out and
    fell in his arms. She was quite upset.
    Caves had been knocking her about.
    Caves came out and started black-
    guarding her. After a little time Caves
    went to get the cows but called in at
    the hotel where witness saw him
    having a glass of beer. Witness told
    Mrs Grayden that she had no right to
    supply the man with liquor. She said
    he was not very drunk. Caves drank
    the beer. Caves and witness left the
    hotel.
    
    To Mr Clarke: Caves appeared to
    be drunk by his manner. He would
    not mistake excitement for drunken-
    ness. Did not see Caves go for his
    horse. He did not notice whether
    Caves walked straight to the hotel or
    not. His brother wired for the police.
    Mrs Grayden did not say the man was
    not drunk. Subsequently he said she
    would not serve him if she knew how
    he had been knocking his wife about.
    He could not remember what she said
    in reply. Mrs Caves said as much as
    that she wanted the police called in.
    
    Anna Caves, wife of John Caves,
    remembered March 8th. Her husband
    was under the influence of liquor. He
    had had a drink and was terribly
    excited. He was not sober. He struck
    her one blow. She ran outside where
    she believed she fainted.
    
    At this stage Constable O’Brien
    applied to put in a statement made by
    the witness and signed by her. Mr
    Clarke opposed this and His Worship
    upheld his contention.
    
    On resuming witness said her
    husband was intoxicated.
    
    To Mr Clarke: Her husband was
    nursing the sick child that day.
    He had had too much drink. He got his
    horse when Mr Kerrisk was there and rode
    it bareback and without bridle
    into the paddock. She did not re-
    member asking Mr Forbes to send for
    the police; if she did she was not
    sensible.
    
    Lillian Caves, being sworn, said she
    was the daughter of John Caves. She
    saw her father on March 8th. He was
    drunk.
    
    Constable O’Brien, on oath, deposed
    that in response to a telegram from
    Mr Forbes he went to Kakaramea.
    He arrived there at about four o’clock.
    Caves was not drunk then but he
    appeared to have been drinking.
    Defendant’s wife said Caves was not
    drunk and that she gave him “porter
    gaff.”
    
    This was the case for the prosecution.
    
    After. Mr Clarke had opened the
    case for the defence he called
    Alfred Hill who, on affirmation,
    stated he resided in Kakaramea. He
    knew Mr Caves. He saw him on the
    afternoon of March 8th about half-
    past two nursing a baby. He ap-
    peared quite sober. He was quite
    coherent in his replies. In witness'
    opinion he was not intoxicated at that
    time.
    
    Dr Nicoll, on oath, deposed that he
    visited Caves’ house on March 8th.
    He had a conversation with Caves who
    he would say was sober. This was
    between five and six o’clock.
    
    Jeremiah Kerrisk, being sworn,
    stated he saw Caves on March 8th
    between three and four o’clock in the
    afternoon. He saw Forbes holding
    Mrs Caves. He went along with
    Caves who caught his horse and rode
    barebacked and without bridle into
    the paddock. He did not think Caves
    was drunk; he thought that he was in
    a temper.
    
    George Butler deposed that he saw
    Caves between 4.30 and 5 o’clock,
    when he was not drunk.
    
    Selina Grayden, being sworn, said
    she remembered the afternoon of
    March 8th. Cave came in the back
    door walked up to the bar and asked 
    for a long “half and half.” He was
    perfectly sober when he got the drink.
    Forbes came in after and told her that
    the man was drunk. She said he
    was perfectly sober. He then asked
    her to go to Caves’ home to see
    Mrs Caves, as Caves had hit his wife
    over the face. She said it was nothing
    to do with her what Caves did in his
    own home.
    
    To Constable O’Brien: In the
    morning Caves had one drink at
    11.30, but did not call again until 4
    o’clock when he had one only.
    
    John Caves, on oath, deposed he
    remembered the 8th March. He did
    not go down to the hotel for a drink
    but to mend a well. He had one drink
    about 11.30 and left there at
    once but came back about one o’clock
    and met Mr Butler, and had two
    drinks then. Went home and found
    his wife lying down, and took the
    baby outside. Mr Hill saw him. After
    the quarrel with his wife. Ho got on
    his horse to fetch the cows, he had
    a drink to cool his feelings. Forbes
    came in while he was having his
    drink and asked if Mrs Graydon was
    home. He finished his drink and left.
    He took the cows home and milked
    the biggest part of the cows.
    
    To Constable O’Brien : He did not
    shout at 11.30, only had one drink and
    left. Returned about 1.30 and had a
    “half and half.” He had three drinks
    at the 1.30 visit. Would not swear to
    the, three drinks. Was certain he was
    sober. He could not say for certain
    whether Mrs Graydon or her sister
    served him with the drink.
    
    This was the case for the defence.

    The defendant was fined £3 and
    costs 13s, and his license was ordered
    to be endorsed.

    EARLY DAYS RECALLED

    SETTLEMENT OF KAKARAMEA

    MR. J. CAVES’ 75th ANNIVERSARY

    Mr. J. Caves, Kakaramea, last week
    commenced the 75th year of his life
    and the 56th year of his sojourn in
    New Zealand, says the ‘News.’ He
    is a jovial man, a lover of good com-
    pany, and a confirmed optimist. In
    the company of other old settlers of
    the Kakaramea district he celebrated
    his birthday in true old-fashioned
    manner, and round the table many
    were the stories recalled or anecdotes
    related of the c,arly days of settle-
    ment.

    Forty years ago great things were
    expected of Kakaramea. A glance at
    the map discloses the lay-out of a
    regular town with streets designated
    for business and residential purposes.
    It was regarded as the future centre
    of the south of South Taranaki, and,
    although these early hopes have failed
    to materialise, the fat lands of the
    district have fully justified the con-
    fidence shown by those who first un-
    dertook the break-in process. It is
    significant also that many of tho rich
    farms are still held by the original
    occupiers or their descendants.
    
    With only a few shillings in his
    pocket, Mr. Caves, who was born in
    London but educated and trained for
    business in Warwickshire, landed at
    Wellington from the sailing ship Bos-
    ton after a voyage of 116 days to
    celebrate his 19th birthday in the raw
    new land of his choice. Only one day
    and night were spent at Wellington;
    then Mr. Caves embarked on a coastal
    vessel for Wanganui, thence making
    his way to Patea. For two years he
    worked on the construction of the Tar-
    anaki-Wellington railway in the Ka-
    kakaramea district, receiving 14s n
    day for himself and his horse. He
    then met with an accident to his leg
    which required a period of rest after
    leaving hospital. This period Mr.
    Caves spent in holiday-making at Wel-
    lington, and later at Auckland. He
    had a particularly rough trip from
    Patea to Wellington, during which he
    preferred to remain on dock all night.
    “Just in case,” he remarked, “the
    boat should founder or be wrecked.’’
    At Wellington he met a fellow coun-
    tryman with whom he travelled to
    Auckland on the Te Anau. Gaieties
    of city life cost money, and Mr. Caves
    was soon forced to seek employment
    again. This he found in farm labour
    at Tairoa, about 100 miles north of
    Auckland on the east coast, There, an
    arduous 18 months were spent plough-
    ing newly brought-in land, cutting
    manuka, fighting fern and converting
    recent bush land into pasture. Work
    commenced at daybreak and lasted un-
    til dark and tho remuneration was 15s
    a week plus keep.

    Tiring of North Auckland, Mr. Caves
    secured a position with a big land com-
    pany operating to improve the pumice
    areas in the vicinity of Putaruru.
    Eleven, years were spent there, during
    which time the young man saved over £300.
    He had married at Auckland
    and, with the capital he now possess-
    ed, a hankering he had always had for
    the rich lands of Kakarameu returned
    so insistently that he packed his pos-
    sessions and moved back to Taranaui.
    It cost him, by the way, £35 to move
    his furniture from Putaruru to Haw-
    era. Before long Mr. and Mrs. Caves
    were installed on a leasehold properly
    at Hurleyville, but the lease falling
    due after five years, he secured a Pa-
    tea Harbour Board lease for 21 years,
    part of the property he still farms
    successfully. At the end of the 21
    years the board renewed his lease (at
    a higher rental, of course) and the
    property is now managed by Mr
    Caves’ two sons.

    Speaking of the early days, Mr.
    Caves humorously referred to the sale
    of milk at 2 1/2d a gallon, irrespective
    of butter-fat content. “Do you
    know,’’ he said, “we farmers could
    never follow the methods of the com-
    pany that bought our milk. We used
    to weigh our supply most carefully
    and count up our tuppence-half-pea-
    nies, but the result never agreed with
    the cheque we received. You see, we
    always reckoned on the basis of l9 lb
    to the Imperial gallon, whereas the
    company based its payment at the
    rate of 11 lb to the gallon. Specific
    gravity of milk didn’t enter into our
    calculations; in fact, 1 doubt if any
    one knew such a factor existed, but
    the company was fully alive to the
    situation. That difference of 1 lb on
    each gallon was a bitter bone of con-
    tention all the time milk was saleable
    only by quantity.’’

    Prosperity and depression have bot
    been experienced by Mr. Caves, but
    they have taken no toll of his hearty
    good humour. As he sat with his
    cronies round a liberal board he dis-
    played as keen an appreciation of the
    good things of life as in the venture-
    some days of his youth. He is still
    able to sing a right good song and
    tell an interesting story, while the fact
    that he has reached his 75th year still
    hale and hearty lie regards as the best
    joke of all.

    by Miss Bertha Caves and Miss Emily
    Thorn as bridesmaids. Mr Fred Gawith
    was best man. Mr and Mrs Tong were
    driven to Hawera, where they left by
    the express for the North on the honey-
    moon trip.
