    A pretty wedding was solemnised at
    St. Mary's Church on Wednesday af-
    ternoon, Rev. J. R. Cassell officiating,
    the contracting parties being Mr H.
    L. Chadwick, eldest son of Mr H. Chad-
    wick, Hawera, to Miss Florence Ger-
    trude Caves, eldest daughter of Mr J.
    Caves, Kakaramea. The Church was
    tastefully decorated for the occasion
    by the members of St. Mary's Sym-
    pathy Guild, while the service was fully
    choral, the bridegroom being a member
    of the choir. The bride, who wore, a
    dress of silk embroidered muslin and
    carried a shower bouquet of chrysan-
    themums and maidenhair fern, was at-
    tended by Miss Bertha Caves and Miss
    Eva Chadwick as bridesmaids. They
    were dressed in embroidered silk mus-
    lin. Mr N. Harris, of Waitara, was
    best man. There was a large number
    of guests present at the subsequent
    reception held at the residence of Mrs
    H. Whittington, South road. The
    bride's gift to the bridegroom was a
    pair of gold sleeve-links, and the
    bridegroom's gift to the bride a
    keeper ring. The bridegroom's gifts to the
    bridesmaids were gold pendants. Mr
    and Mrs Chadwick left by the after-
    noon train for the south on their honey-
    moon trip. The bride's travelling dress
    was a brown costume with hat to
    match.

    "THE CRUCIFIXION."

    On Wednesday evening, at St.
    Mary's Church, the choir, under the
    direction of the choirmaster, Mr G. A.
    Burgess, performed Stainer's beautiful
    Passion work, "The Crucifixion." The fine
    choruses which occur through the
    cantata were given with careful atten-
    tion to expression. The light and
    shade in the prayer, "Jesu, Lord Jesu,
    bowed in bitter anguish," the forceful
    vigor of the great chorus, "Fling Wide
    the Gates" and the full choral effects
    in the triumphal chorus, "From the
    Throne of His Grace," were features of
    the work of the choir. The short sec-
    tions for male voices wore effectively
    sung.

    The tenor solo work, which includes
    some of the most beautiful airs in the
    cantata, was allotted to Mr C. E.
    Smith. He acquitted himself excel-
    lently, and sang the fine recitatives and solos
    with deep feeling and in proper
    spirit, showing a true appreciation of
    the composer's ideas. He was in ex-cellent
    voice and sang well all through.
    In the solo, "King Ever
    Grlorious" he was at his best. It was
    a fine effort.

    The bass solos were sung in pood style
    by Mr H. L. Chadwick. The work
    makes considerable demand on the
    singer. Mr Chadwick acquitted himself
    with credit, and sang with good effect.
    Several of the striking recitatives were
    sung with care and with good expres-
    sion by Mr J. C. Smith. The well-
    known quartette, "God so loved the
    World", was sung as a semi-chorus. It
    was sung in good style, especially the
    second verse, unaccompanied.

    The choirmaster had his choir well
    under control. There was a good
    volume of tone. The soft chorus work
    was well sung, and due attention was
    paid to light and shade.

    Mrs King, the church organist, pre-
    sided at the organ and played the
    lovely accompaniments and interludes
    with care and expression.

    MR PEARCE v. MR POWDRELL.
           ----
    To the Editor.

      Sir, —I used to learn at school that
    there were two kinds of lies, and that
    a black lie was worse than a white one,
    but in last night's Star I saw a
    "Whyte" lie, which was sufficiently bad
    to warrant a reply. The letter contain-
    ed a sentence saying that the chairman
    and committee supporting Mr Pearce
    at Waverley recently approached Mr
    Pearce asking him to stand down, as
    his chance was hopeless. I rang Mr
    Pearce and Mr Hemingway today. and
    they both state that such a statement
    is absolutely false. Mr J. Walker has
    wired me: "With regard to Whyte's
    letter in the Star, I or any of Pearce's
    committee emphatically deny ever ask-
    ing Pearce to stand down." The same
    statement was made from the platform
    at Mr Powdrell'e Waverley meeting.
    Mr Walker denied it from the hall, and
    Mr Dickie, who is one of Mr Powdrell's
    strongest supporters in Waverley, ac-
    knowledged Mr Walker's statement, as
    correct. Where does Mr Whyte get his
    unreliable information from? Sure-
    ly, if he believes all he hears, he
    should eat all he sees. His enthusiasm
    knows no bounds, for he says that Mr
    Powdrell will take several thousand of
    Mr Pearce's votes. Whew! The votes
    cast in 1914 only totalled 6658, and
    Mr Pearce received 3388: so not
    too much of the several thousand,
    please. Mr Pearce had a majority of 118
    in 1914, and after four years and
    ten months some one woke up, rubbed
    his eyes, and said that Mr Pearce was
    weakening. He evidently saw a plant
    that had grown from a seed privately
    sown some time back. If Mr Whyte
    would analyse the position he would find
    that Mr Pearce had an adverse
    vote in Aramoho (now cut out), a
    suburb of Aramoho, where the Liberal-
    Labor support was exceedingly strong.
    Again, seven strong members of the
    Liberal Party (the famous Flying
    Squadron) went through this elector-
    ate, speaking on behalf of Mr Morrison.
    If Mr Pearce could hold the seat
    against such an invasion, it is some-
    thing to his credit. It is generally ac-
    knowledged that the Liberal Party's
    candidate has weakened considerably
    since 1914, so Mr Pearce could have
    won easily on a straight run. A house
    divided against itself cannot stand, so
    if the seat is lost to Reform do not
    lay the blame at the door of Mr Pearce.
    Mr Whyte makes a sarcastic remark
    about loyal Reformers trying "to save
    their present member and their mas-
    ter's deposit," but he will probably find
    that on the 17th inst. Mr Pearce willl
    be "master" of the situation. To dis-
    tort his concluding sentence somewhat,
    Mr Pearce can win the seat, so they
    won't throw their votes away on Mr
    Powdrell.-- I am, etc.,
       H. L. CHADWICK.

    TAWHITI SCHOOL. There was only a moderate attend-
    ance at the meeting of householders
    held at the Tawhiti School last even-
    ing. Mr. T. H. Walker presided. 
    ...
    There were eight nominations for the
    new committee, and the following were
    elected: H. L. Chadwick, J. Winks,
    W. Reid, J. B. Laurenson, W. H. Mc-
    Donald, F. T. A. Duncan, and W.
    Williams.
      The candidates were fairly evenly
    supported, only three votes separating
    those who topped the poll from those
    returned with the lowest number of
    votes. The candidate who did not
    secure election was not present,and
    was only one vote below the next in
    the list.
      At a subsequent meeting of the new
    committee, Mr. Chadwick was elected
    chairman and Mr. Duncan secretary
    and treasurer.
      It was decided to hold the monthly
    meetings on the third Tuesday in each
    month at 7.30.
      Accounts totalling £11 5s were
    passed for payment.
      The chairman and secretary were au-
    thorised to operate the banking ac-
    count.
