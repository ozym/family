   ... Edward was christened on 14 September 1712 at Ashby Parva, a small village adjacent to Gilmorton.
   He died at his home in Lambeth, now part of London, on 2 October 1781. He had taken his skills as a
   joiner to London and developed a successful business as an undertaker. He had invested the profits
   wisely in property and became a Freeman of the City of London. In 1774 Edward gave 600 pounds,
   invested in British Government Stock at 3%, for various Gilmorton parish charities, including the
   foundation of a school, named Gilmorton Chandler, to educate children within a Christian atmosphere.
