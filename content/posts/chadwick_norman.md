 New Zealanders on the Somme. 
  
  A Stirring Story 
   
   The following interesting and stirring story of the Big Push was received recently by Mrs P 
   Bourke from her brother, Rflm Norman Chadwick, who left with the 8th Reinforcements, Lord 
   Liverpool’s Own, and took part in the fighting on the Somme, fortunately coming through 
   unscathed.  Rflm Chadwick says: — “Just a line to let you know I am still on the earth. Well, I 
   suppose you have realized by now the account of our attack on the morning of —— 
   September.  We arrived in the trenches on the night of the —— and stood there, shivering 
   with the cold until morning.  I was glad when I heard the bombardment was to be very short. 
   About 6.20 a.m. hundreds of guns opened up at the same second.  At 6.26 the first wave of 
   troops went over the parapet. Well I never saw anything like it in my life.  For miles on our 
   left and right Fritz was putting up red and green signals. Red for artillery and green for 
   attack.  Before our boys were in Fritz’s front line we were on the way over.  By this time Fritz 
   had just put his high explosive barrage in front of us.  Machine guns were cracking and the 
   place nearly choked us with the smell of powder.  Our men fell like skittles.  The front line 
   was soon taken and I can tell you there were some dead Huns lying about.  Those who did 
   not stop and fight, went for their lives, our artillery cutting them up as they went.  It was now 
   our job to go on and take the second trench, another 1200 yards distant.  Our artillery swept 
   the place as we followed it up.  Shells of all sizes were dropping in amongst us.    Dead 
   Germans, our dead, dying and wounded were lying all over the place.  Machine gun bullets 
   were coming in all directions and sometimes make a man’s hair stand up straight.  We could 
   still see Fritz clearing from one line to another.  I forgot to tell you we had four of those 
   caterpillars with us.  They are a sort of an armoured car and weigh a few hundred tons.  This 
   was the first time they have been used and of course Fritz did not know what the devil was 
   coming.  He put his machine guns on to it but it was like hitting an elephant on the rump with 
   a cane.  Well we took the our line (2nd) and as far as we were concerned had finished the 
   job.  Another battalion went on to the third.  A machine gun in this line was giving trouble so 
   the caterpillar went ahead and put it out of action.  It also went right along the trench driving 
   Fritz out.  Major Pou took up a bombing squad and caught 150 as they came out of the end 
   of the trench.  Major Pou is a white man, and its dollar to doughnuts on him being 
   recommended.  He was wounded and went leading his men and right through the piece 
   treated his men as men.  Later on the fourth line was taken, so by dinner time everything set 
   out to take was taken.  Once that day Fritz massed troops for a counter attack, but our 
   aeroplanes sighted them and our artillery gave them a few bars of “You remember me.”  My 
   opinion is that once Fritz is got out of the front line any troops could chase him as far as they 
   like with walking sticks.  There’s no get away if a man gets near him, up goes his hands and 
   you will hear him yell out “Mercy Kamerade.”  We have been taught all along that there’s 
   only one good German and that’s a dead one.  Every other day other battalions of other N.Z. 
   brigades were attacking and gaining a few more hundred yards.  Fritz counter attacked them 
   but our boys stayed and put them back.  Stayed like bailiffs.  
    
     
Some days we were up to our hips in mud.  Forty eight hours after the attack we came back 
a couple of miles and put the night in on a hill which had been shelled all that day with tear 
shells.  Well we were dead beat.  It rained all night and next day.  Next day, wet through, we 
went back into the trenches.  The communication trench was too deep with mud so we went 
overland.  We slipped and slided from one shell hole to the other.  Well we got there (pitch 
dark) and got into the trench.  In some places it was up to our stomachs in mud and yet they 
reckon they are going to keep the Huns on the run all winter.  They might too, if they hook 
the men on to the caterpillars.  Going across and taking the positions was not the worst. 
Standing in the trenches and continually being shelled gets on a man’s nerves.  A man can’t 
fight the artillery, so what must it be like for Fritz because we have ten times the amount he 
has.  Well we went back and forwards from one trench to another for 24 days.  The Tommies 
have never heard of any troops being in so long before.  From the time of the attack until we 
came out we must have advanced somewhere about 3½ miles.  We were congratulated by 
the troops on our right and left and by every nation, but that won’t buy back the men who fell. 
We were told by the heads of armies that there were no better troops in the world, and I am 
quite sure there’s not.  There’s more bull dog rush in our mob.  The way they went forward I 
thought that volunteers had been called to back to New Zealand to catch Rua.  I shall never 
forget the sights seen going across.  We are well out of it now having a spell, but where to 
next God knows.”

Interesting Running Commentary 
 
 
The following interesting running commentary of the experiences of some New Zealanders 
on active service is taken from letters written by Rifleman N. Chadwick (4th Battalion New 
Zealand Rifle Brigade) to his relations in Hawera: 
 
When I wrote on September 5 I gave the names and places and dates of the visits there up 
to August 14 but could not give later travels at the time owing to censor­ship.  I am now able 
to continue so here goes. We left Armentieres on August 14, and marched to Steenwork 
(about seven miles). We boarded the train the same day, and went to a place called 
Eblingham.  We left there at 9 pm on the 20th and marched to St Omer.  Left there at 1 a.m. 
next morning, and went to Longpre, passing through Calais, Bolougne, and Etaples on the 
way.  We were 40 to a truck, and were eight or nine hours on the trip.  When we got to 
Longpre we had a 12 mile march to a place called Huppy, arriving there in the afternoon on 
the 21st.   
 
There we were put in training.  We practiced taking a small wood there, which was supposed 
to be like High Wood (Somme), and which we were told we had to take. We left Huppy by 
road on September 2 for Longpre. Next day we arrived at St. Vaast.  We stopped there a 
couple of days.  From there we went on to Allonville, and from there to Dernoncourt, and 
from there to Fricourt. We covered over 100 miles by foot from the time we left Armentieres 
until we arrived at Fricourt. On September 10 I sent you a postcard saying that you would 

not hear from me for three weeks or more, as we were to go into action in a few days, and if 
I came out in on one piece I thought I would be ‘dead sweet’ for a while.  Well, the guns were 
wheel to wheel for miles, and the noise and concussion was terrible.  Well, now for the 
approach to the battle­ground and the battle itself.  From Fricourt we went to the trenches. 
As soon as we got into the communication trench, Fritz started to “strafe” us.  We were going 
for our lives up the trench, tramping over dead Germans, and being ‘strafed’ all the way. 
 
We got there in the finish with a few casualties. We were there for 48 hours and, being in the 
front line, things were not so bad, but the supports, as usual, got hell. That 48 hours was 
only to let us have a look at the place we were to attack a couple of days later. The New 
Zealanders’ front was between High Wood and Delville Wood. 
 
We came back to the trenches on the night of September 14. The night was very cold, and 
we had no overcoats; only our fighting gear and equipment allowed to be worn.  The 
morning came, and everyone was as cool as could be. We knew where we were fighting and 
the allotted hour, and everyone knew what to expect. We were to take the Huns by surprise, 
and there is no doubt we did. At the same day and hour every nation was attacking so that 
Fritz could not move reinforcements as he liked. At 6.20 a.m. the bombardment started, and 
at 6.26 the barrage of shell fire had lifted from the front line, 800 yards away, to the second 
line. As soon as the barrage lifted our men were in their front line. I never saw such a sight in 
my life.  As far as I could see Fritz was putting up red and green signals – red for artillery 
and green for attack. A few minutes after the first line had gone forward it was our battalion’s 
turn to take the second line, 2000 yards distant.  While the first line was being taken we 
hopped out and went forward.  By this time Fritz had put his high explosive barrage in front 
of us.  Machine guns were cracking and the smell of powder nearly choked us. Our men fell 
like skittles. By the time we reached the front line our wounded were going back and 
prisoners were going back in dozens.  The front line was soon taken, but that had nothing to 
do with us. 
 
We crossed that, the trench being full of dead Huns. The front line was taken that quickly 
that we had to wait in the open until our barrage moved forward. Then we went on, shells of 
all sizes dropping amongst us. As the smoke cleared away we could see Germans, who did 
not wait to fight in the front line, clearing for their lives, but they were cut up by our artillery, 
which swept the place as we followed it up. We had not gone far past the front line when a 
Hun machine gun opened fire on us.  In every shell hole there were dead, wounded, and 
dying. Some yelled out to us to come and “tie them up” but we had been told long before that 
it was not allowed. 
 
While waiting for our barrage to lift we sat in a shell hole. In two shell holes together there 
were seven of us, including our skipper (Captain Powley). While sitting there talking on after 
another got knocked out, until only myself and on old fellow remained.  As the barrage went 
forward we went on, and at last reached our objective.   
 
Every other man was carrying a pick or a shovel on his back, and it was our job to dig 
ourselves in. There was no argument about that. Everyone dug for his life. 
 Other battalions coming up had to take the third and fourth lines. By 12 o’clock everything 
we had to take was taken. Once that day Fritz massed troops for a counter­attack, but our 
aero planes sighted them, and the artillery gave them a few bars of “You’ll remember me.”  
 
The Tommies on our left were held up for a while, but in the finish took High Wood and came 
on. There was only one thing wrong with our attack. We went forward too quickly and Fritz 
could enfilade us with his machine guns.  From the time the New Zealanders started until 
they finished they must have advanced three to three and a half miles. The whole distance 
was just covered with dead, dying, and wounded – Germans, equipment, rifles and packs, 
arms, legs, heads and pieces of men lying in all directions. 
 
A man did not take much notice of this going across, but after we had taken our trench we 
started to think of what we had seen. Our line was now the third line, and the German fourth 
line was now our front line, and you should have seen our wounded going back. 
 
If people could see the whole business the war would finish tomorrow. It will give you an 
idea, when I tell you that out of some platoons of forty strong, only a dozen got across. 
Forty­eight hours after the attack, we were relieved by another New Zealand Brigade, and 
were marched out on a hill a couple of miles away. The hill had been shelled with tear­shells 
all the afternoon, and the tears just rolled down our cheeks.  Dog­tired, and our eyes stinging 
with this stuff, we were properly beat. We were out for 24 hours and it rained all the time, 
and we were not away from shell fire then. 
 
Next night, back we went again, wet through, and knee deep in mud. The communication 
trench was too deep in mud so we went overland, falling into shell holes ten feet deep, every 
few yards.  Well, we got there in a few hours, and without a word of a lie, went up to our 
stomachs in mud.  We were in this for two or three days. While there other New Zealand 
battalions were attacking every day, and gaining a few more hundreds of yards.  Forty 
counter­attacks, but our boys stayed and put them back. They stayed like bailiffs.  We were 
kept there, going from one trench to another for 24 days. 
 
The men were getting weaker and their nerves getting worse every day.  The attack itself is 
nothing.  A man gets worked up and excited but after a trench has been taken and we have 
to stand there without sleep and face bombardment from daylight till dark, the mob soon go 
to pieces.  A man can’t fight the artillery so what must it be like for Fritz because we had 10 
times the shells he has. 
 
I’ll guarantee that during the last few days we would not have been able to stop a Salvation 
Army.  The Tommies on our right and left had been relieved five and six times, but the New 
Zealanders still stopped in.  Our company went in 174 strong and came out with under 50, 
so you can see the luck a man wants. One Wai­kato company struck it rough, only 10 men 
and one officer coming out.  It is marvellous how anyone gets out of it safely.  
 
A funny thing happened on day when we were in the fourth line trenches.  A Hun plane 
came over, and dropped a message with a weight and their colors attached to it.  Someone 
yelled out “Look out for the bomb”. We rushed in all directions.  It turned out to be a 

 message from one of our airmen, who had some time been taken prisoner.  Sid Goddard 
was shot through the heart as he was crossing our trench.  He was buried about half a mile 
from Flers by Jeffries, a corporal in our platoon. I saw Andrew Coleman wounded in the arm 
as I went across.  Young Tong found Charlie Langdon lying alongside the communica­tion 
trench.  Bob Ure had two fingers blown off, one broken and three wounds in his left arm. 
Reid and Rodgers, from Hawera, were both killed. We were properly done up when we 
came out.  We had to march seven miles with sore feet, through mud up to our knees.  We 
put in a day at Mametz Wood.  Next day we marched to Albert and then went by train to 
Longpre.  From there we went to Bray.  Only a quarter of the men got there that night. 
Hundreds fell out, and slept by the side of the road until morning.  We left Bray on October 
11 and marched to Abberville.  Went by train up the same old line (eight hours’ trip) and 
finished up a couple of miles outside Bailluil, 10 miles from Armentieres.  I must tell you we 
had four of the ”tanks” or ”caterpillars” with us.  They are a sort of armoured car, and weigh a 
good few tons. They can travel over any ground, and push trees down, or go through a brick 
wall.  They were a great help but got ‘smacked up’ in the finish.  They were kept secret for a 
long time, the men in them being practically kept prisoners for months.  They had small guns 
and machine guns mounted on them and went ahead of us. One went right through a brick 
building at Flers and smashed up all the machine guns.  This was the first time they were 
used and the Huns wondered what the devil was coming.  He put his machine guns onto it 
but it was like hitting an elephant on the rump with a cane.  A machine gun in the third line 
gave a lot of trouble so the tank went ahead and put it out of action.  It also ran along the 
trench and drove Fritz out. 
 
Major Pou took a bombing squad up and caught 150 as they came out the end of the trench. 
Major Pou is a “white man” and it’s dollars to dough­nuts on him being recommended. He 
was wounded and went on leading his men right through the piece, treated his men as men. 
After this battle my opinion is that once you get Fritz out of his front line, you could chase 
him as far as you like with walking sticks.  There is no get­away if a man gets near him, up 
goes his hands, and he will yell out “Mercy, Kamerade”, but in an attack like that a man is 
not responsible for what he does with a rifle and bayonet.  We have been taught all along 
that there is only one good German, and that is a dead one.  
 
We were congratulated by the troops on both sides of us, and by every nation, but that won't 
buy back the men that fell.  We were told by the heads of other armies that there were no 
better troops in the world, and I’m sure there’s not.  There is more of the bulldog rush in our 
men.  The way the boys went forward I thought that volun­teers had been called to go back 
to New Zealand to catch Rua. I shall never forget the sights I saw when going across.  We 
are out now having a spell, and as they are starting leave to England again, I’m look­ing 
forward to a stroll through London soon.

On Active Service  
 
Further Interesting Stories 
We print as a continuation of what appeared in the Star on Saturday February 10th, the 
following further interesting extracts from letters written to his relatives in Hawera by 
Rifleman N. Chadwick of the 4th Battalion of the N.Z Rifle Brigade, on active service in 
France. 
 
I met my brother the morning after coming out of the trenches at the Somme.  He said he 
wanted to have a buck at the Huns.  I told him he would only want one buck.  (News has 
since been received of H. G. Chadwick being wounded on the 4th February). 
 
I said in my last notes that we finished up at. ——. From there we marched to a small village 
and were then brought on by motor lorries to ——, two miles behind the line.  They are 
issuing leather waistcoats today.  I forgot to tell you about the cove who went over to the 
Germans in the trenches at Armentieres.  About 2000 of us were carrying up gas cylinders 
that night and he took his hook across.  He was a German all right, and, for what happened 
afterwards, he gave a bit of news away.  That is fair dinkum.  I believe he came from 
Carterton.  I believe I’ve often told you about the way the other brigades used to throw off at 
us because we were in the Rifle Brigade;  or the “Dinkums” as they called us.  They don’t do 
it now as we have the “wood” on them.   
 
The Otago’s of the 2nd Brigade took the first line (800 yards) but our brigade took the other 
three, covering nearly 2½ miles.  Other brigades took some trenches, but we did three or 
four times as much as they.   
 
We have a new skipper.  He is the fourth captain we have had.  Captain Stansell was the 
first and a fine chap, too.  He was killed the first time he went into the trenches.  Captain 
Powley was killed down at the Somme.  Captain Logan was wounded a few days later.  Now 
we have a Captain Williams. 
 
I have been in hospital for five days with influenza.  This is my last day.  It is a N.Z hospital 
and we are treated A1.  Chicken for dinner and fruit for tea.  Porridge for breakfast (cream on 
it, too), chocolate, cigarettes etc.  Bit rich eh?  I ran into Billy Donnelly in there. 
 
Back in the trenches again.  We have been told several times that we are going back to 
Egypt for the winter, and then again we receive lectures on frostbite, etc., so that makes it 
look as if we are to stay where we are.  We have struck a pretty quiet part of the front just 
now.  It has been raining for a week, but the trenches in our part are fairly dry.  
 
They have big drying rooms behind the lines.  Everyone has been supplied with gumboots 
and clean, dry socks are issued every morning, so there is no reason for anyone getting wet. 
Next month it will be pretty cold.  The snipers are more deadly up this way.  We were not 
troubled much with them down south;  they had not time to snipe.  One of our men caught a 
Hun Red Cross man sniping away good­oh, but he did not have another shot.  By jove, all 
our Red Cross men deserve the V.C for the way they worked.  It is a terrible strenuous job, 

 carrying anyone out, especially over slippery ground and the shell­swept places they had to 
go to.  They were called poultice­wallopers and all sorts of names at one time, but not now.  
 
Frank Sisley lost his leg.  He was in our section and got his toes crushed with a nose­cap 
going across on September 15.  His food got pretty bad and he had to part with it.  Young 
Arnold go a smack on the head with a piece of shrapnel and was in the hospital the same 
time I was.   
 
The last man was picked for England while I was in hospital, but my turn must be close. 
This is the way they work the leave. All the men who first came over with the 4th Battalion, 
and who went through the Somme, go first, and then the Reinforcements No. 10, 11, and so 
on in that order.  One of our chaps (writing from England) said that London was “some” 
village.   
 
We are now situated a little to the right of ——. Yesterday Fritz brought up one of his 
Minnie­whoffa guns, and put half a dozen minnies over.  One of our mob sighted his gun 
smoking and told the skipper, who rang up the artillery.  In a few seconds our shells were 
going over thick and heavy.  I don’t know if we hit or not, but it never put any more over. 
 
Raiding is a great game.  When a party is going to raid they all blacken their faces so that 
they can’t be seen so well.  Then they go halfway across “No Man’s Land” and lie down.  At 
a given time the artillery and trench mortars open up and clear the enemy’s wire away and 
bombard his front line.  By this time Fritz will be at the bottom of his trench or in his dug outs. 
All of a sudden the artillery lifts to his second line and the raiding party rushes up and 
catches Fritz with his head down.  They are only allowed a few minutes there and then they 
have to get out and go for their lives, the artillery playing on the front line again while they 
are getting back.  These raids were very successful, the raiders taking a few prisoners and 
gaining fresh information each time.  Fritz has taken “a tumble” now and when we start to 
raid he turns everything he has on to “No Man’s Land”. He started raiding then, but he gets 
some crook spins, I tell you.  Sometimes we would be in Armentieres when a raid was on, 
and the whole town would tremble.  The town was full of guns, and the shells whistled over 
the billets like one thing.   
 
Very often, mostly at night, Fritz used to strafe the town, and a man had to go for his life to 
the cellars.  One night they put four shells into our billet, but most of us were in the cellars in 
time.  Four were hit, and two were killed.  I was never so pleased in my life as I was when I 
left the town.  The night we left Fritz bombarded the town for six hours killing dozens of 
civilians and a good few Scotties. Sailly, Bac St. Maur and Fleur Baix are fairly close to the 
trenches. The people are all Flemish there and a man has to keep his mouth shut.  The 
towns are never shelled so it looks funny. 
 
If I ever go back to the Somme I suppose I’ll be dead meat, as I was lucky getting through 
once, let alone twice.  But I suppose they glorious work has to go on.  They say the fist five 
years are the worst of this life. 
 

 Roumania is getting a bad spin, but she has a very big front to hold.  I believe it is bigger 
than that Western front.  Anyhow, Fritz is a gone coon.  It’s only a matter of time.  I reckon if 
they advance much more down on the Somme he will have to withdraw from here.  It only 
rained for two days when we were down there, and we were past our hips in mud.  The 
ammunition wagons were up to the axles in mud.  In some places they had to carry the 
ammunition up to the batteries on horseback; about four shells strapped on each side of a 
horse and a string of horses a mile long. 
 
I saw in the paper that the Huns sank the Alaunia.  She was the boat that bought us over 
from Alexandria and also took the first lot of New Zealanders to the Dardanelles. 
 
I was in Fleur Baix last night.  One of our engineers had a fox terrier, which has been 
following him for months.  It has been to the Somme and back.  Last night it had a fight with 
a dog belonging to a French woman in there.  They fought for half and hour.  All the old 
French women in the village were out with brooms trying to stop them, but the mob made a 
ring and kept them off.  Everyone was barracking for our dog, but I’m blowed if the “frogie” 
didn’t smack him up. 
 
I’ve just been along to have a talk with some of the mob who are billeted in a brick building 
along the road.  The Australians have a battery behind it, and every time it speaks three or 
four tiles drop out of the roof.  
 
 Aeroplanes are up by the dozen just now.  One of Fritz’s planes was up just now hanging 
about, and the anti aircraft guns were going like one thing; but their planes fly high, and do 
not take the risks that our jokers do.   
 
We are out at present what they call having a “spell.”  One thing about being out we can 
always get a wash and take our clothes off to sleep.  Down south we did not have our 
clothes off for nearly a month and we didn’t have a wash for two and a half weeks.  You 
should have seen the whiskers on the mob when they came out of the trenches. 
 
Of course down there we got very little sleep.  I suppose you wonder how we sleep at all 
while the “straffing” is going on; but a man gets sort of dog­tired, and can sleep in any old 
position.  I have seen men go to sleep standing up and drop down like a log.  They soon 
wake up when the ground hits them, and wonder what happened.  Up here it is different. 
When stand down comes off we go into the dug­outs but always sleep with clothes and 
equipment on.   
 
Well it is getting on towards Christmas, and a man will have his Christmas feast in the 
trenches this year if he’s lucky.  I believe leave is being granted to Paris for three days.  That 
does not affect our leave to England.  But getting leave is like a lawyer going to heaven. 
 
The Maoris are camped near here and some of them are characters.  They generally roll into 
an estiminet about 6 o’clock and start a sing song.  A few of them used to belong to that gaff 
“Hinemoa” and its just a shame how they can sing. One joker sings a song called “Wait till 
the war is over” and I tell you it’s “bon.” 

 At last we have got some fine weather.  It has rained for about three weeks, so there is a fair 
amount of mud about.  I have left the old platoon and have joined the Vickers Machine­gun 
Section.  I am in the same gun team as “Rusty” Douglas and Charlie Cischetto, who is a 
sergeant in charge of three or four guns.  You will remember Charlie; he was as member of 
the Hawera railway staff and he is a white man.  He won the Military Medal down south, and 
it was a very popular win. He is a brave or game joker and a great battler for his men.  Being 
in this, one does not do the fatigues like the infantry, so if I am kept in it I will have a better 
time.   We are a company of our own, but still cover the Rifle Brigade.  Most of these men in 
the machine­gun section are old B Company men and some fifth platoon men as well. 
 
I received your letter of September 29, and also one from mother dated September 20.  The 
news of the smack­up of the 15th must be been slow getting to New Zealand as she did not 
mention it in her letter.  You speak about the fight for Flers.  That was the most brilliant piece 
of work of the whole lot, and the Brigade received great praise from the Tommy heads; the 
New Zealanders did the work, or most of it.  The Tommies were held up, and the way the 
New Zealanders swung round and went through was a treat.  Truly, a man thought nothing 
of going across.  What I noticed most was that everybody was smoking.  I don’t know why 
unless it was the excitement.  I know I smoked cigarettes galore going across.  When under 
bombardment the first thing a man does is to light a cigarette.   
 
I believe Outram Yound, of Otakeho died of wounds.  He was the whitest and gamest man 
I’ve ever seen.  From the first night we were in the trenches in France he thought nothing of 
going out on patrol or looking for snipers.  Any man in the company would follow him 
anywhere.

Life at the Front 
 
A Hawera Boy’s Notes 
 
The following are extracts from letters recently received from Gunner Norman Chadwick by 
his relatives in Hawera: 
 
Dec 12 ­ I have been asleep alongside the cookhouse stove and am nearly baked.  I have 
just been called to take my place on gas guard.  I saw the hottest and cheekiest thing today 
that I have ever seen.  The sky was very cloudy, and the clouds very low.  I was in the 
cookhouse, and heard the buzz of an engine and as it was so loud I said to my mate that 
something bigger than a plane was going over the line.  We looked but could see nothing. 
All of a sudden out popped a Hun ‘plane not a hundred feet from us.  It turned and came 
back right over our cookhouse.  For a while the mob was struck dumb.  We made a dive for 
our rifles, but by the time we got them he had gone further back over our lines still flying low. 
Everyone thought he was looking for a place to land.  The Maoris, further back, and the 
anti­aircraft guns, fired a few shots as a warning to land.  He flew along the ground for a 

 about a mile, gradually rose, and went for his life back to his own lines.  He must have 
picked out a few of our batteries on the trip, and I suppose we will know all about it 
tomorrow.   I think he must have got lost in the clouds, and dived down to see where he was, 
and found himself in our lines, because Fritz flies very high as a rule. The whole mob are 
talking now about how they could have brought him down, but it’s too late now because he 
will have an iron cross by this time. 
 
Bapaume, our objective down south, will fall at any time now, so don’t be surprised at any 
pushing. 
 
I was picked for a raid which was to come off some time ago, but it was postponed.  Since 
then I have joined the machine­gun section, so will be out of it.  Anyhow, I will be in the front 
line while it is on, so I expect a good old strafe. 
 
Fritz raided last night, pretty well in front of us.  Five of our men on a Lewis machine gun 
were wounded by one of his bombs.  Only two Germans got into the trench, but none got out 
again.  One was getting away with the machine gun, taken off our wounded men, when he 
was shot dead on the parapet. Fritz raids silently, and unless a man keeps a sharp  look­out 
he will be caught napping. 
 
Jan 20 ­ Well we spent Christmas and New Year in the trenches on the front line.  Our 
artillery put over more shells on Christmas Eve than I have seen for some time.  It was a 
miserable night, drizzling and blowing like dickens.  The rest of the week was very quiet until 
New Year’s Day, which Fritz thought he would celebrate, and put over a terrible lot of shells, 
some being tear shells, but he got a jolly sight more back.  We came out of the front line 
soon afterwards, and are now having a good old spell a few miles behind the lines. 
 
Snow has been lying on the ground for the last fortnight, and when there is a breeze that is 
the time we feel it.  It takes us all our time to keep our feet warm, but it is not for the want of 
clothing. We have plenty, including leather waistcoats and sheepskin coats.   
 
At night I generally go over to an estiminet and write. They have a bosker stove and it’s A1 
being there after being out in the snow all day.  Some of the tables have very flash covers on 
them, one in particular which I would like for a souvenir.  In one corner of it is the photograph 
of the man who composed the “Marseillaise”.  In the centre is another picture of him singing 
the song, and the audience with their mouths open in wonder.  The verses serve as the 
border.  Along the top it explains who the man is, and how he came to put the song together. 
The walls of the estiminet are covered with notices about loans, the calling up of different 
classes of troops and warnings to us not to speak to military matters in estiminets.  There 
are bullet holes in the ceilings, put there in the early stages of the war. 
 
A few days ago we were billeted with a “froggie”. He was telling us that he has a son who is 
a prisoner of war in Germany. Every fortnight he sent food to him, but the son never receives 
it.  He also told me that he often got letters asking him to send beans, but the letters are not 
his son’s and he found out after that Fritz was getting them and planting them.  Now he 
soaks them in boiling water for a few minutes before he sends them. 

 Well its the 20th of the month and the New Zealand “cockies” will be putting out their hands 
for their cheques.  We put ours out to­morrow for 30 francs (£1 1s 6d).  That is pretty light for 
a fortnight, but they keep back 10 francs a fortnight in case we go on leave. 
 
We have a fellow here, who had just arrived in one of the latest reinforcements, and joined 
up with us.  He is as silly as a rabbit and is always “taking off” Charlie Chaplin.  The mob 
keep on telling him that if he does not sit down, they will spilt his ear and put his foot through 
it. 
 
January 28th ­ We have had our spell and are now back in the trenches again.  The snow of 
three weeks ago is still on the ground, four inches deep.  But talk about frosts!  If a man got 
a Taranaki frost, he would break out in a sweat.  The ice on the drains is two inches deep, 
and the mob is out skating on it all spare time.  We go out hunting for wood, and drag it 
down the drains on top of the ice.  The pump outside is frozen stiff and we have a job to get 
water to put down it before we can get it to work.  If a man wants a shave he will find his 
shaving brush stiff and then I’m blowed if the towel is not hard too.  It takes us all our time to 
tell whether the bread is stale or only frozen.  If this is “Sunny France,” hell can’t be so bad. 
 
Although we are in the trenches, we are some distance back.  Every day one or two guns go 
out and fire on to Fritz’s roads, trying to catch his working parties coming to or going home 
from the trenches. 
 
So Fred has been called up has he? Well, that’s pretty hot, after two of us already being over 
here.  I believe the ———— family have been having a bad spin with sickness.  Well, if any 
of those single ones were over here, they would have missed all the sickness.   
When a mob have nothing to do and are sitting round the coke stove, it would make you 
laugh to hear the arguments.  It generally starts about the North and South Islands ­ which 
has the most champions, murders, dry districts, tourist resorts, etc. Everyone is talking at 
once in the finish. 
 
When we are in the front line (I will be going up there in a few days’ time) we cannot do 
much writing, as we are sleeping most of the day.  There are seven of us in the gun team at 
present, and two at a time go on guard through the night, so you see we don’t get much 
sleep at night.  Last time we were up there we used to sit up round the coke stove.  The 
concrete dug­outs are so cold, and with damp boots and equipment always on, we could not 
sleep.  As for taking off our clothes, that seldom happens.  It is nothing to go for a month or 
two without taking our trousers off.  But, there is one thing, we can always get plenty of water 
to drink and wash up there. 
 
February 5 ‒ Things are pretty quiet on this sector at present, and some days you would not 
know there was a war on, as sometimes a day or two will go by without a shell coming over 
from Fritz.  Of course, our batteries are always going and it would surprise you to see how 
much Fritz stands. Even when we send a raiding party over, and bring a few prisoners back, 
his batteries don’t open fire. He is either short of ammunition or is saving it up for 
somewhere else.  He will want it all, because the next offensive cannot be far off.  It’s the 

 same with the Huns themselves.  As soon as our batteries open fire at night Fritz clears for 
his life back to his supports.  But a salient raid will catch him every time.  The other night 
they called for ten men and an N.C.O. (voluntary) to go across. In a few minutes they were 
across in Fritz’s front line playing hell, blowing up dug­outs. killing some, and bringing back 
prisoners.  As a rule the Huns are caught in their dug­outs, and won’t come out.  So in goes 
a bomb or two. That fetches them. 
 
Before I came over here, I often wondered why the fighting did not go on through the winter, 
but after seeing snow on the ground for over a month and the thickness of the ice, I can 
understand.  When one goes into action, there are no such things as blankets, and with this 
weather a wounded man would be frozen to death very quickly.  The French people say that 
this is the coldest winter they have had for fifteen years.  At night we often have a wood fire 
to sit round, but in daylight out it goes, for the Huns would locate our trench by the rising 
smoke and drop a shell into it.  A little while back a German shell struck a tree not far away, 
and broke a big limb off it.  There was a great rush and scramble for it, and our team 
secured it for a back log.  It was a decent one too.  The estiminets have certain hours to 
keep to over here (12 to 2 and 6 to 8 p.m) and if they are not closed during the other hours 
it’s a case.  The military police are very strict and for a few minutes late in closing, they are 
put out of bounds for a good length of time. 
 
When firing on to Fritz’s roads, everything is connected by telephone, and from the 
observation posts we get our targets.  Everything is worked out from the map, and in a very 
short time we can lay on to any road, no matter how it twists or turns. 
 
I don’t know how this war goes on. You can’t compare the two sides. In everything Fritz 
takes on he finishes up second, always.  I have had twelve months of this now, and it seems 
like years, but I think this next offensive will finish the war.  I suppose we will get a second 
helping but I’ll guarantee Fritz will dread it coming on worse than we will.

Hawera Boy’s Experience 
 
Private Norman Chadwick, writing on December 11 to his father, Mr H Chadwick, says: 
 
“We are at present, about seven miles past Namur, having passed through there this 
morning. For the last three weeks we have been on the road, and I can tell you we have 
covered some ground, and we still have another 50 miles to go to the German border.  The 
trek through has been fairly interesting as we have called in some fair sized towns, and of 
course had a good time.  Charleroi is a town with a population of 10,000 and although it has 
been under German rule for four years, everything is going strong there. The coal mines are 
still working, picture palaces and music halls are open, cafes and restaurants with a good 
stock, and the town in good condition. Anything, including foodstuffs, could be bought and 
that is a thing we could not buy behind our lines while the war was on.  We hear a lot from 
the civilians about what a hard man Fritz was, but he has not done much harm to this town. 

 Namur is very much the same as Charleroi, but this place, I believe, has been knocked down 
and rebuilt. 
 
All the towns are decorated with flags of the Allied nations, and the people crowd out in the 
streets and stare at us as we go by.  They all take us for Americans and very few know there 
is such a place as New Zealand. 
 
Dec 14 – We are now in a place called Flone, about 22 kilometres from Liege.  We are to be 
here for four days.  As you will see by the map, since August we have travelled a very long 
way from Hebuterne.  I don’t know how far that is, but if I say 200 miles I don’t think I will be 
far out. 
 
After a month’s waiting a New Zealand mail has started to arrive and everyone is receiving a 
fair bundle”. 
 
Since the letter arrived. Mr. Chadwick has received advice that his son is returning to New 
Zealand shortly.
