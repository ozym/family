      ---------
    The death took place at the Patea
    Hospital on Saturday of Mrs A. A.
    Caves, wife of Mr John Caves, of
    Kakaramea. The deceased lady had
    been a resident of Kakaramea for the
    past 20 years, and was held in the high-
    est respect by a large circle of friends,
    who will deeply regret her demise.
    
    The late Mrs Caves was always to
    the fore in helping her neighbours, par-
    ticularly in cases of sickness. She is
    survived by Mr Caves and a family of
    three daughters, Mrs P. W. Tong
    (Kakaramea), Mrs W. Large (Kaka-
    ramea) and Mrs Leo. Chadwick (Hawera),
    and two sons, Messrs W. and A. Caves,
    of Kakaramea.

    Cemetery to-day, the cortege leaving
    the Hospital at 2 p.m.

    PERSONAL ITEMS.

    Our Kakaramea correspondent writes
    as follows: One of the oldest identities
    of Kakaramea passed away at the Pa-
    tea Hospital on Saturday morning in
    the person of Mrs A. A. Caves. The
    deceased lady took seriously ill on the
    20th June, and was removed at once to
    the hospital. She lingered painlessly
    there until Saturday, when she passed
    quietly away. Mrs Caves was 61 years
    of age, and although born in England
    had lived most of her life in New Zea-
    land. She resided for upwards of 20
    years in Kakaramea. Her genial and
    great hearted personality will be great-
    ly missed in Kakaramea, as she was
    renowned for her constant willingness
    to assist those in sickness and in
    trouble. She is survived by her hus-
    band, Mr J. Caves, and a grown-up
    family of three daughters and two
    sons, namely, Messrs William and
    Archibald Caves (Kakaramea), Mrs P.
    W. Tong and Mrs W. Large (Kakara-
    mea), and Mrs H. L. Chadwick (Ha-
    wera)
