> ! THE FIRST BALLOT. TAftANAKPS QUOTA. ' On Thursday night a "Gazette Extraordinary" was issued in Wellington giving the names of the 4000 odd men who have been selected by lot from the Ist Division of the Expeditionary Force Reserve for service with the New Zealand Expeditionary Forcfl The ballot was taken last week to fill shortages in the 23rd and 24th Reinforcements. Very many more names than were actually required were drawn, to allow for exemptions from vaiious causes, including medical unlituess. Publication of the names in the "Gazette" is deemed to be sufficient notification of a man's selection, but every care is fceing taken by the authorities to advise each man individually. In many cases the reservist will receive his notification even before ho seas his name in the newspapers. There were four recruiting districts which supplied their quotas for the 23rd and 24 th Reinforcements by voluntary enlistment. They were:— Xo.' I—Auckland City. j x O . 7_Hawke's Bay. | No. 12—Nelson. Xo. 20—Wanganui. Following are the names of the men of whom the lot fell in No. 8 (Taranaki )Recruiting District. Included in the list are many men who have already volunteered, and been declared medically unfit. Only fifty-nine men are required, and the number drawn is much in excess of this, in order to allow for medically unfit men and those who are excused from service by the Appeal Board.

> 'Oh, yes, I've had some surprises during mj two years' service at the front, but I never expect a greater surprise than my experience just over twelve months ago at Raffa, in Palestine." This was the comment of a returned soldier in chatting of his experiences to a Wanganui Herald representative. The soldier in question, Sergeant J. Chadwick, has been invalided home and is at present on a visit to relatives in Wanganui, accompanied by his father, Mr "Joe" Chadwick so well-known in sporting circles throughout the Dominion. Sergeant Chadvr}c&^ivaa farmina in the hinterland of Wanganui—in the Waimarino— when the war broke out and at once set about disposing of his holding. Having been in the South African campaign where he was a member of the Sixth Contingent and connected wivh General Plumer's flying column he was eager again for service abroad when the call came, but he- did not succeed in getting away till the sth Reinforcements left, when he was appointed Quartermaster-Sergeant He was in the Romani fight' when 4000 or 5000 prisoners fell to the lot ot the British, and in the clearing operations around Bir-el-Abd,, where our troops suffered much in the forced marches over desert sands in tropical leat and a shortage of water. In the ii? ,adv. arlC6 on El Arish and at Mag-' dhaba he was prominent, being mentioned in despatches for conspicuous work as troon sergeant at the latter place, where 1600 troops and a number of guns were captured. The advance continued, and on 9th January .1917, Raffa was the objective. Here a big battle took place. 'After a long night march in a cold piercing wind the mounteds —cavalry and camel corps— arrived early in the morning, in the vicinity of Raffa, which they proceeded to surround, men being sent out in all directions. Fighting continued all day 'and by nightfall between 1400 and 1500 nrisoners had been captured, and a quantity of supplies and guns About 4 o'clock iii the afternoon the British forces .commenced closing in rapidly on Raffa, as word had been received that 4000 Turkish" troops were coming to the- succour of the enemy garrison. Sergeant Chadwick's troop were advancing in attack formation in the rear of the main redoubts, which for some hours had been subjected to artillery bombardment. The first redoubt was duly captured, in which the commanding officer and other staff officers were taken prisoner. Sergeant Chadwick and a number ot men pushed on to the next redoubt over the brow of the hill. Between the two redoubts were a large number of mules laden with provisions, including cases of wine, which had been packed for the purpose of retreat. While the men turned their aftention to these. Sergeant Chadwick rushed forward to the next redoubt hopped oyer the rear of the parapet with fixed bayonet, and to his amazement found himself in a narrow trench with ten or a dozen Turkish and Arab officers in the redoubt. They had been watching events from the front of the redoubt, upon which British troops were advancing, and were equally dumfounded to find themselves attacked in the rear. This was obviously no time for explanations or apologies. Recovering from his momen- - tary shock—though it wa s difficult to say who had received the greatest .shock, the attacker or the attacked—• Sergeant Chadwick ordered the officers to drop their arms and take off their ; belts. Imagining that there was a force immediately behind him, and deeming discretion the better part of valor, the Turks promptly dropped their revolvers and took off their belts Only one proved obstreperous. He wa s conspicuous with two stars on his epaulette. Indignant at the idea of being compelled to throw off his belt, • he cried, gesticulating wildly, "Me no Arab; no me Arab!" At that precise moment Sergeant Chadwick "didn't care a continental," as he remarked, xvh»it nationality he was; he had to be quick and lively.- So a prod or two of the bayonet had the desired effect, and the discomfited and disgruntled officer was marched to the rear with the other surprised members of the staff, who realised their mistake when it was too late. They were ordered to join the other prisoners who were being collected in the rear, and then a dozen men, who were further on in the trench, seeing their officers surrender, followed suit, preferring to be taken in the rear'than to risk being captured or shot in the front of the redoubt.
>
> When the redoubt was cleared of men, Sergeant Chadwick set about gathering up the spoils—belts revolvers, gear for telephone, and' case for instruments, etc. Th c telephone itself had been smashed to pieces by a shell, which had also killed the officer in charge of same.
>
> Fossicking round, Sergeant Chadwick came across the quartermaster's "bivvy," where he found that officer's books. Turkish orders in book form, field glasses, revolvers, while in the store were quantities of overcoats, stacks of tea in little packets baked bread, shaving and hair-cutting apparatus, including; razors and clippers. Ihe snoils consisted of. %wo bags (used for sand) full, which he had collected before : anyone else entered the redoubt. The orders, which proved to ba very useful, were despatched to Divisional Headquarters, and 6 ome of the spoils reached Wanganui After "clearing up" at Raffa, the troops retired back to the base - the hero of the incidents above recorded receiving a well-merited spell on the beach. Shortly afterwards he had a bad attack of rheumatics and was invalided to Cairo. He recovered sufficiently to participate in the capture of Gaza. In August last he was again invalided, and after undergoing several operations wa s eventually ordered home, leaving Cairo in December for New Zealand.
