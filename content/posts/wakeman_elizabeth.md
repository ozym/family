Elizabeth Wakeman ...

> In reply to your questions as to my grandmother's maiden name etc., It was her mother who was the Mrs. Wakeman of _Berkford Manor_, who displeased her family (a big old one and Roman Catholic one) by marrying a Church of England clergyman of the name of _Owen_. -- _Frances Mary Hobkirk (nee LeCesne) 1881_

> You now see how I came to be born in a house in the Crescent in Bath on the 22 of August, 1808.  Why the Selby's and the LeCesne's chose that city to reside in, I do not know.  At that time, Bath was a very fashionable place, and many of the French prisoners (officers on parole) resided there; and with many of them my parents were acquainted.  Perhaps alas, my mother required the treatment of the Bath waters.  The society of Bath was also very good; and the Selby's always kept up caste and were now also on very good terms with their Worcestershire cousins, the Wakeman's of Berkford Manor.  Besides, there were other cousins, the Welch's and Long's and others in Worcestershire whom they used to visit.  I recollect being on a visit at Berkford Manor, when I was about 4 years old. -- _Frances Mary Hobkirk (nee LeCesne) 1881_

Elizabeth Wakeman was the eldest daughter of Henry Wakeman, Esq. and Frances, daughter of William Higford, Esq., of Dixton, county Gloucester, and Dorothy, his wife, daughterof Robert, Viscount Tracy.

Dorothy was the daughter of Robert, Viscount Tracy, and his wife Anne, eldest daughter of William Dowdeswell of Pool-Court, in Com. Wig. Esq. (However, this Robert may have in fact been Robert, son of Viscount Tracy).
