    OBITUARY.

    Mrs. H. H. CHADWICK
    -------------------

    A pioneer settler of the Hawera dis-
    trict, Mrs. H, H. Chadwick, died at
    Patea on Thursday after a long illness.
    She had reached her 70th year and had
    been in the district, mainly at
    Hawera, for nearly 60 years. She
    had suffered from illness for several
    years and her passing was not unex-
    pected.

    She was born at Wangaratta,
    Victoria, and came with her
    parents as a child of nine to Whenua-
    kura. She was one of the first pupils
    at the Whenuakura School.

    She was married in Patea and lived
    first at Auckland and later at Strat-
    ford, Manaia, and then at Hawera,
    where she spent about 40 years.

    Mrs. Chadwick was a keen supporter
    of the home industries section at all
    the district shows and at Palmerston
    North and Wanganui, and had often
    won points prizes in cooking at the
    Egmont and the Winter Shows.

    She is survived by a family of nine:
    Four daughters, Mesdames A. Wan
    (Opunake), P. A. Bourke (Whenua-
    kura), Lash (Dannevirke), and J. H.
    Horton (Hawera), and five sons,
    Messrs. Leo and Fred (Hawera), Hec-
    tor (Feilding), Norman (Taihape), and
    Harry (Wellington). Her husband
    predeceased her by 11 years.

    There is one brother, Mr. G. Johnson, in
    Wellington, and two sisters, Mrs. H.
    Hughes (Sydney) and Mrs. P. Hurley
    (Western Australia).
