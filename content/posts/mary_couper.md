In the Scottish Court of Sessions, 16th December 1829, the case between Archibald Grassie and Mary Couper is outlined whereby Mary claims Archibald Grassie it the father of her _natural_ child. Mary was a servant in the household where Archibald lodged, as is described as _of a facile weak disposition, and that the advocator frequently gave her spirits, and used improper familiarities with her". Her child was born on 14th February, 1827, and, although not named, would fit with _Alexander Grassie_ born in Lochee, Angus about 1827 (1871 Scotland Census). His marriage to Elizabeth Small, 27th August 1855 in Dundee, gives his age as 28 and his residence as Lochee. His father is listed as Archibald Grassie, Excise Officer, and his mother Mary [Gasson or Gatton], unfortunatley his mother's name is not given on his death registration (April 14th, 1897 aged 68).

In the 1841 census of Loche, _Pallers on a Fuis_ a houshold is listed as _Barbara Cowper_ (40), _Elizabeth_ (35), Ann (25), Alexander Gray [sic] (14), and Mary Bain (9). The suggestion being that _Gray_ should have been recorded as _Grassie_. The 1851 census of Liff and Benvie, has a household: _Alexander Grassie_ (24) Head with _Betsy Cooper_ (36) Aunt, and _Anne Cooper_ 31 Aunt.

Mary Bain married James Ferguson and died in New Zealand in 1913, where her death certificate lists her parents as [_Lauchlin_] Bain and _Mary Cooper_,
