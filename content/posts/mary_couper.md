In the Scottish Court of Sessions, 16th December 1829, the case between Archibald Grassie and Mary Couper is outlined whereby Mary claims Archibald Grassie is the father of her _natural_ child. Mary was a servant in the household where Archibald lodged, and is described as _of a facile weak disposition, and that the advocator frequently gave her spirits, and used improper familiarities with her_. Her child was born on February 14th, 1827, and, although not named, would match one _Alexander Grassie_ born about 1827 in Lochee, Angus (from the 1871 Scotland Census). His marriage to _Elizabeth Small_ on August 27th, 1855, in Dundee gives his age as 28 and his residence as Lochee. His father is listed as _Archibald Grassie_, Excise Officer, and his mother Mary (Gasson, Gatton, Basson, or perhaps Batton), unfortunatley his mother's name is not given on his death registration (April 14th, 1897 aged 68).

In the 1841 census of Loche, in Liff & Benvie, the household of _Patersons Feus_ is listed as _Barbara Cowper_ (40), _Elizabeth_ (35) linen hand loom weaver, Ann (25), Alexander Gray \[sic\] (14) linen hand loom weaver, and Mary Bain (9). The suggestion being that _Gray_ should have been recorded as _Grassie_. The 1851 census of Liff and Benvie, has a household: _Alexander Grassie_ (24) Head, dyer, with _Betsy Cooper_ (36) Aunt, and _Anne Cooper_ (31) Aunt.

_Mary Bain_ married _James Ferguson_ on May 30th, 1850 in Lundie and Fowlis. The family moved to New Zealand where she died in 1913, her death certificate gives her parents as _(Lauchlin) Bain_ and _Mary Cooper_.

Following up on the _Patersons Feus_ household, _Barbary Coupar_ was baptised on February 13th, 1797 in Lundie and Fowlis, Angus. Her parents are given as _John Coupar_ and _Elspeth Blyath_ \[sic\]. This family also had children Margaret (February 14th, 1794), James (July 3rd, 1795) in Lundie and Fowlis, and under the name of _John Couper_ and _Elspeth Blyth_ a _Mary Couper_ (May 20th, 1792) in Fowler Easter, Perth, and under _John Coupar_ and _Elspit Blyth_, _Betty Coupar_ (March 30th, 1804), _Ann Coupar_ (August 11, 1812), _Janet Coupar_ (June 27th, 1806), _William Coupar_ (born February 9th, 1800), _William Coupar_ (born Februay 13th, 1810), _Thomas Coupar_ (March 23, 1801), _David Coupar_ (March 28th, 1808) all at Lundie and Fowlis, Angus.

The parents, _John Cuper_ and _Elspeth Blyth_ were married at Fowlis Easter Parish on August 17th, 1791.
