    OBITUARY

    MRS A. A. CAVES
      ---------
    The death took place at the Patea
    Hospital on Saturday of Mrs A. A.
    Caves, wife of Mr John Caves, of
    Kakaramea. The deceased lady had
    been a resident of Kakaramea for the
    past 20 years, and was held in the high-
    est respect by a large circle of friends,
    who will deeply regret her demise.
    
    The late Mrs Caves was always to
    the fore in helping her neighbours, par-
    ticularly in cases of sickness. She is
    survived by Mr Caves and a family of
    three daughters, Mrs P. W. Tong
    (Kakaramea), Mrs W. Large (Kaka-
    ramea) and Mrs Leo. Chadwick (Hawera),
    and two sons, Messrs W. and A. Caves,
    of Kakaramea.
    
    The funeral takes place at the Patea
    Cemetery to-day, the cortege leaving
    the Hospital at 2 p.m.
