Ann Chandler died on September 20th, at Brown Street, Timaru, the widow of
Charles Berjew Fooks, late of Christchurch, aged 76 years. -- Timaru Herald, (Oct 2, 1879).



Born in Holborn, London, in 1803, Ann emigrated to New Zealand following her husband and son, Charles Edward Fooks.
Together with her sisters and their families, she left Deal, England, aboard the "William Hyde"
on Tuesday, the 21st October, 1851. -- Lyttelton Times, (Feb 14, 1852 -- Page 6).

Ann Chandler was the wife of Charles Berjew Fooks, and a sister-in-law of the brothers:
Joseph & William Guise Brittan, who together married three of her sisters. Charles was
by training an architect, but appears to have been more of an investor and land developer.
It appears, other than marry Ann, that he wasn't too successful and eventually being
charged with ... while working ... and sent to Gaol, with hard labour.

Born in ..., Ann came from a fairly wealthy family of Fleet Market Undertakers. Her parents,
Edward Chandler and Ann Dolby were married in St. Sephulchre Parish in Holborn, London.

    "St. Sephulchre, Holborn, Parish Records" 1754 - 1932 
    No. 20
    Edward Chandler of this Parish a Bachelor & Ann Dolby of the Parish of
    Winkfield in the County of Berks a Spinster were
    married in this Church by License
    this Twenty Fifth Day of February in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred
    and Ninety Seven -- By me Tho. Richards Curate
    This marriage was solemnized between Us Edward Chandler / Ann Dolby
    In the Prefence of Charles Dolby / Nancy Fisher

Although her birth entry doesn't mention her mother's maiden name:

    "St Sepulchre, Holborn London"
    Ann Chandler, daughter of Edward and Ann Chandler, christened Jul 12, 1803, born Jun 11, 1803

Luckily on the night of the 1841 census she was present with her sisters and aunts:

    Calpham Road Portland Place, St Mary Lambeth, Surrey, England
    HO107 1055/6 pg. 7

    Sophia Chandler, Female 35
    Louisa Chandler, Female 30
    Harriet Wicks, Female 70
    Elizabeth Dolby, Female 70
    Ann Fooks, Female 35
    Elizabeth M Brittan, Female 25
    Joseph Brittan, Male 4
    Adelaid M Brittan Female, 0
    Ann Kemp, Female, 30
    Hester Ladd, Female, 25

which leads to the birth records of,

    Harriot Dolby married John Harris Wicks on Feb 15, 1790 at Sunninghill, Berkshire, England
    (but also Feb 11, 1790 at both Hampshire, England, and Salisbury, Wiltshire, England)

John Harris Wicks was of Egham, Surrey, having " .... presided thirty years Master of Englefield School, in this Parish [Engham]"
(monument in Egham Church).

"... Wicks had set up Wicksâ€™s Academy in Englefield Lodge (also known as Englefield House), Middle Hill in 1787 for the sons of gentlemen. An annexe to the house served as a schoolroom but the boys also boarded. By 1790 the school was successful enough for him to be able to marry Harriet Dolby from Sunninghill." -- eghammuseum.org

It's worth noting that Winkfield, where Ann Dolby was from, was roughly only five kilometers from Edgham, and Sunninghill, which are close to Windsor Park.

"And in Christchurch, "Englefield Lodge", built by William Guise Brittan in 1855/56" with the presumption that it was designed by Charles Fooks -- http://www.heritage.org.nz/the-list/details/1867

In Sunninghill, George Dolby was awarded "1st Allotment, No. 6 - [Near Thatched] Lane"
