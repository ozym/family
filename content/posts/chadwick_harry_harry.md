> February 5. — An inquest was held this morning before "W. G. Malone, Esq., J.P., acting coroner, on the body of George Etherington {alias Ward). The following jury was empanelled :—: — Messrs R. Hirschberg, W. D. Thompson, H. H. Chadwick, H. Hewer, J. Kirkwood, J. McCartie, and C. Cullen, of whom Mr Hirschbei-g was chosen foreman. Joseph Taylor was sworn. He was a labourer of Waverley now engaged on the Government co-operative works on the East Road, about 30 miles from Stratford. Identified deceased as his mate, occupj'ing the same tent with himself, and a man named Corcoran. On Friday night last they all turned in about U p.m. It was blowing hard. About 11 p.m. a limb of pukatea, about 30 feet in length, was blown on to the tent across Etherington and Corcoran's bunks. After the smash he pulled Corcoran from under without assistance, but could not get the limb oif the other man. Two or three more men then came, and they got deceased out. He was then alive. They carried him to another tent , and about 12 o'clock he died. The limb had struck him on the head, smashing it in. He knew deceased by the name of Ward, in which name he had registered at the Co-operative office. He believed he was a single man. The tent had been pitched by deceased. When going to bed deceased had remarked that they would fell the pukatea before going to work in the morning.
>
> T. Arnold, another co-operative man, gave evidence as to having helped to get deceased from under the limb. It was customary for each to pitch his own tent.
>
> G. A. Harrison, medical practitioner, described the injuries, which were sufficient to cause death, and would be likely to be the result of such an accident as given in the evidence of previous witnesses.
>
> The jury without re tiling brought in a verdict of accidental death due to the falling of a limb of a tree. The injured man, Corcoran, is at the Club Hotel, and is doing well considering the nature of the injuries.
