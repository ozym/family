    PERSONAL

    The late Mr. Caves who died on
    Sunday last at the ripe age of 81
    years came to New Zealand some 62
    years ago, and was for some time en-
    gaged on the work of constructing the
    railway line between Wanganui and
    Patea. He afterwards removed to
    Litchfield, Waikato where he was mar-
    ried. Returning to Taranaki he was
    farming at Hurleyville and later at
    Kakaramea, where he resided up to the
    time of his death. He was for some
    years a director of the Kakaramea Co-
    Operative Dairy Company. Mr.
    Cave's wife predeceased him 17 years
    ago. He leaves a family of two
    sons, Messrs Archibald and William
    Caves of Kakaramea, and two daugh-
    ters, Mrs. H. L, Chadwick (Hawera)
    and Mrs. P. Tong (Manaiii). There
    are 15 grandchildren and [14] great
    grandchildren. The funeral took
    place at the Patea Cemetery yester-
    day afternoon.

    -- Patea Mail, 26 September 1941
