Joseph Chadwick arrived in Otago sometime before 1863 as there's an Application for an Auctioneers' License advertised in the Otago
Daily Times of Feb 7th, 1863 and dated Feb 5th. There is a notice of him auctioning the Royal Hotel in Dunstan on 22nd June 1863.
Another advertisement, in September 1863, lists _Joseph Chadwick and Co._ as holding an auction at the _New Market Sale Yards, High Street,
Dunedin_, with a trailer of _J. C. and Co. having had great experience in the above line for the past twelve years in Victoria, New South
Wales, and this Province, earnestly request a share of public patronage_.

In 1865 there's an advertisement for an Auction on September 28th, 1865, in Rangitikei by Joseph Chadwick & Co., Auctioneers, Wanganui. The
last advertisement in Otago is dated April 29th, 1864.

ABSTRACT OF SALES BY AUCTION

Dec 27 -- JOSEPH CHADWICK, at his rooms Victoria Avenue, Wines Spirits and Ales.

The Fine Arts in Wanganui. -— A painting, won by two gentlemen, in Wanganui,
in the English Art Union prize lottery, was raffled yesterday at Mr. Jones's bookseller.
The painting is a water color, and obtained the second prize in the Art Uuion of 1866,
and was valued at £210. The subject is— "Deborah sitting in judgment." Yesterday,
Messrs. McCaul, Reid, and Peter Lang of Wellington, threw the sampe number (41) each,
and they agreed to have the painting put up to auction, and the proceeds divided.
Mr. Lewis, who represented Mr. Laing officiated as auctioneer. The picture was sold
to Mr. Joseph Chadwick for

A HARD CASE AND A CAUTION.

Yesterday, at the Resident Magistrate’s Court, Mr. Joseph Chadwick was charged by Harry Williams with having given to him a receipt for £lO, and neglecting to stamp the same. It appears, that Mr. Chadwick in the hurry of business, received the £lO from Mr. Williams, gave him a receipt for the money but forgot on the spur of the moment to put a penny stamp on it. Williams laid his information and Mr. Chadwick was fined £lO and costs.

This penalty has been inflicted under Clause fifteen, of the “ Stamp Duties Act Amendment Act, 1867” which reads as follows. “ Every person who from and after the commencement of this Act shall written or signed, any receipt, discharge, or acquittance, for or for the payment of money liable to any duty charged by the said Act, upon any vellum, parchment, line, or paper, without the same being first duly stamped, shall forfeit and pay the sum of ten pounds for every such offence.”

We are not aware what portion of the fine in this case goes to the informer, as it appears from the “ Stamp Duties Act, 1866," that the convicting magistrate has no power in the matter; that is reserved for the Commissioners of Stamps. It is desirable that the_ public should know what an informer is entitled to in such cases.

W here the requisite stamp, as in the present case, would cost only one penny, surely the fine of £lO is monstrously disproportionate to the offence. Without a stamp, the receipt would be valueless, and therefore the person receiving an unstamped receipt knows that he is receiving waste paper, and therefore unless, as in the presnt case, where he wishes to turn informer, would refuse to take it. Consequently, a fine of ten or twenty times the stamp duty—say ten or twenty pence—would be sufficient to protect the revenue; a fine of £lO is oppressive, and in every case the informer’s conduct must be vindictive. He need not take an unstamped receipt, and the law should not countenance vindictive proceedings, or unnecessarily encourage informers. The man who accepts an unstamped receipt is accessory to a breach ot the law, and does so that he may have a chance to prosecute a man who lor one penny would riot be guilty of the offence—therefore, in his case he is liable to a heavy penalty for sheer neglect of forgetfulness ; nothing more. We consider the man receiving the unstamped document with a guilty knowledge of the fact far the more culpable of the two. In any case, we say again, the fine is monstrously disproportionate to the offence, and until that clause of the Act is amended fines inflicted under it should be remitted.— “Wanganui Times.”

WANGANUI CAVALRY.

The following letter has been received from Major Nixon :—
                Wanganui, May 3.
        Dear Sir, —- I take the earliest opportunity on my
return from Manawatu to acknowledge the receipt of your letter,
dated the 26th April, informing me that during my absence the
Wanganui Volunteer Cavalry had unanimously elected me as their
captain. At present I can only thank them, and this I do with
all sincerity and much satisfaction for the honor thus conferred
upon me, but beg to assure them that the honor, efficiency, and
true interests of the corps shall ever have my zealous care and
strict attention. I trust also that every member of the corps
will feel the same pride and zeal in belonging to it that I
myself do.

We regret to hear of a painful accident befalling Mr Joseph Chadwick this (Thursday) morning. He was about proceeding to Turakina to attend a sale,
and on passing Mr Signal's stable at Campbelltown, the horse he was riding suddenly swerved, putting its feet into some soft clay, and coming down
on its nose. Mr Chadwick was thrown, falling heavily on some gravel, and was picked up evidently suffering great pain, Drs. Earle and Tripe were
immediately sent for, and on examination found that several ribs were broken, besides a severe shock to the whole system. The horse had been
bought a few days previously from Mr Signal, and was familiar with the entrance to the stable.

-- September 23, 1873
Mr Joseph Chadwick anounces himself as a candidate for the extraordinary vacancy in Queen's Ward. We notice that independence in all matters is promised by the candidate.

> __THE LATE MR CHADWICK__
>
> The Wanganui Herald, referring to the late Mr Chadwick, says:
> The late Mr Chadwick, who was born in London, went to sea as a young man,
> and spent several very exciting and adventurous years in the suppression of the slave trade.
> Returning to shore pursuits, he went through a course of engineering, and was one of those employed in the fitting of the machinery at the London Exhibition of 1851.
> In 1853, he decided to seek fortune in Australia, and with his wife and family sailed in the ship Allapore for Victoria,
> where he established himself as an auctioneer, having branches in several towns, with headquarters at Ararat.
> In this capacity he was very frequently employed, by the Government of Victoria, for whom he sold a large quailiity of land.
> During this time he also served a term as a councillor of the borough of Ararat, which was at that time one of the chief mining towns of the colony.
> On one occasion, at this time, the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, visited, Ararat. The townspeople wished to entertain him at a banquet,
> but there was no hall large enough for the purpose. Mr Chadwick promptly built an addition to his auction mart, and here the function was held.
> Mr Chadwick also had extensive business connections in New South "Wales. After ten years spent in Australia, Mr Chadwick joined in the exodus
> to New Zealand following the discovery of gold in this country, and in 1863 arrived in Otago, where he joined in the Dunstan rush.
> Later, he went to Havelock, when the Whakamarina rush was on, and after a short stay there, came to Wanganui in 1865, and settled down here as an auctioneer and general agent.
> For some time he was the leading stock auctioneer on this coast, holding regular sales at Wanganui, Rangitikei, Marton and Turakina.
> He was also a very large wool buyer, though the risks attending what was then a very fluctuating movement made his operations in this respect unprofitable.
> He was sergeant-major in the Wanganui Cavalry, and also had charge of the commissariat in the campaign against the Hauhaus led by Titokowaru,
> and later was a lieutenant in the Campbelltown Rifles, receiving the New Zealand War medal for his services.
> For ten years he sat as a member of the Wanganui Borough Council, and it was largely owing to his efforts that the policy of street tree-planting was entered upon.
> He took a great interest in sport, and for many years was one of the trustees of the Wanganui racecourse, but only ran a few horses here,
> being associated vith Mr Geo. Walker in the ownership of Peter Flat.
> He was also a past master of the Masonic order.
> The members of the deceased gentleman family were: Mrs E. N. Liffiton {Wanganui), Mrs Geo. Hurley (Wellington), Mrs J. W. Falkner (Wanganui), Mr Joseph Chadwick (Auckland),
> and Mr Harry Chadwick (Hawera)
