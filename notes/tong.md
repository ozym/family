> A pretty wedding of much interest to South Taranaki residents was solemnised in St. John’s Presbyterian Church, Hawera,
> on Wednesday, May 1, when Ena Winifred, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. W. Tong, of okaiawa, and formerly of Kakaramea,
> was married to Andrew Robert, second son of Mr. and Mrs. D. Wards, Okaiawa. The Rev. K. J. Watson was the officiating minister
> and Mr. Rowe presided at the organ.
> Bowls of pink and white chrysanthenums and asparagus fern were artistically arranged in the church,
> the work being done by friends of the happy couple.
> Ivory silk velvet formed a charming frock for a very pretty bride, who entered the church on the arm of her father.
> The close-fitting bodice had the cowl neckline clasped with a diamante clip and tight-fitting sleeves, the skirt
> falling in flared folds forming a slight train. Exquisitely embroidered tulle first nestled at the head as a Juliet cap,
> clasped by sprigs of orange blossom, and then fell in all its bridal glory to form a shaped train.
> Ivory embossed velvet shoes and stockings to match and a pearl necklet, lent by the bridegroom’s mother, were worn.
> Lastly there was the sheaf of beautiful cactus dahlias, begonias, and asparagus fern with touches of spring flowers lending a delicate fragrance.
> The bride was attended by her cousin, Miss Gwenneth Chadwick, who wore a dainty ankle-length frock of pastel pink Swiss crackle organdie patterned
> in flowers of deeper tonings. The fitting skirt, inset to the knees, with godets of tiny frills of, plain organdie and with the full puffed sleeves
> to the elbow inset with frills to match, were a charming contrast to the "window box" bodice, which was adorned with geranium pink silk velvet flowers.
> Also in attendance was Miss Ethel Wards, sister of the bridegroom, who wore a frock of blue Swiss crackle organdie cut on the same lines. The frocks
> were girdled with sashes of silk velvet, and each carried a floral muff to tone. They wore picture hats of organdie banded with velvet, also mittens
> and velvet shoes to match. Each wore a handsome crystal necklet, the gift of the bridegroom.
> A glimpse back to little maids was given in the picturesque frocking of the very young flower girls, Betty Tong and Lorna Penbarthy, of Palmerston North, both being cousins of the bride.
> These demure little ladies were frocked in pale pink and blue organdie respectively, made with tight fitting bodices, puff sleeves, and full flared skirts, hiding diminutive shoes.
> A wreath of velvet flowers to match their frocks was a suitable head-dress, and both carried Old World baskets of matching begonias, hydrangeas, antirrinhums and maidenhair fern.
> They both wore gold bangles the gift Of the bridegroom. The floral work was the work and gift of the chief bridesmaid, Miss Gwenneth Chadwick. In attendance as best man was Mr. Hector Wards,
> brother of the bridegroom, and Mr. Ian Tong, brother of the bride, acted as groomsman.
> On leaving the church, members of the Hawera Highland Pipe Band formed a guard of honour, and later piped the bridal party to the reception.
> The bridegroom has been a member of the band for the past ten years.
> After the ceremony a reception was held in the Rewa Tearooms, where 146 guests enjoyed a delightful wedding breakfast. A three-tiered cake took pride of place on the bridal table,
> this being the work and gift of the bride’s aunt, Mrs. H. L. Chadwick, Hawera., To receive the guests Mrs. Tong, mother of the bride, wore a smart tweed ensemble with hat, shoes,
> and stockings to tone, and carried a posy of autumn-tinted flowers.
> Mrs. Wards, mother of the bridegroom had chosen a smart black coat with matching scarf, hat, and shoes, and carried a posy of flowers in red tonings.
> Amid showers of confetti the young couple left on their honeymoon, the bride travelling in a fashionable wine georgette and lace frock with matching coat and hat.
> Brown suede shoes, stockings, gloves, and handbag completed a very pretty ensemble. The young couple, who leave at the end of the month to take up their
> residence in Pukekura, Cambridge, were the recipients of numerous and valuable gifts.
> Among the guests were relatives and friends from the Waikato, Manawatu, and Taranaki districts.
