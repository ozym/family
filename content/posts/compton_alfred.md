The certified copy of the registration of death for __Catherine Fooks__ lists her parents as
__Alfred Compton__ and __Eliza Compton__ nee __Bryant__. That she was 69 years old,
when she died, on Oct 18, 1901, and that she was born in _Islington, London, Middlesex_.
It also shows she married __Charles Edward Fooks__ when she was 18 at _Kennington, London, England_.
The equivent document for __Charles__ lists that he married __Catherine Mary Compton__ when he
was 21 in _London_, he died after her in 1907.

There is likely to be errors in the transcripton and in the information given, however, there is a
christening for a __Catharine Compton__ [sic] on Oct 3, 1832 at _Holy Trinity, Clapham, Surrey, England_.
Her parents are listed as _Alfred & Eliza Compton_. This would match her age at death. Her marriage
is also registered on Jan 16, 1851 at _Kennington, Surrey, England_.

Catherine's sister, __Elizabeth Jane Compton__, was christended on Jan 6, 1832 at __St. Mary's, Lambeth, Surrey, England__, daughter
of __Alfred & Eliza Compton__. __Elizabeth__ died in 1904, aged 72, which also matches her birth of roughly 1832. Her burial entry,
for _Ashburton_, gives her birth date as Jun 14, 1831.

DEATH. 
Compton.—On March 1st, at Park House, Ashburton, Elizabeth Jane Compton. Aged 72 years.
-- Ashburton Guardian, Volume XXI, Issue 6207, 1 March 1904, Page 2
Obituary. —Miss Elizabeth Jane Compton, for many years a resident of Ashburton, passed away early this morning at the advanced age of seventy-two years. The deceased lady came to this colony with her father in the ship "Cashmere" in 1859, and resided in Christchurch till 1878, when she came to Ashburton. She was a sister of the late Mrs. Fooks with whose family she resided up till the date of her death. St. Stephen's Church has lost a faithful and earnest worker in Miss Compton, who was an enthusiastic member of St. Stephen's choir for many years, and also taught in the Sunday School attached to that Church.

-- Ashburton Guardian, Volume XXI, Issue 6207, 1 March 1904, Page 3
`

The "Cashmere" sailed on Jun 10, 1859 from Gravesend and arrived on Oct 11, 1859, in Lyttelton. The "Shipping News" from the Lyttelton Times, Oct 12, 1859, lists

    ARRIVED.

    Oct, 11, ...
      Same day, ship Cashmere, 514 tons. Byron, from
    London.
      Chief Cabin.— Passengers for Canterbury. Mr.
    Mrs. Miss and Master Ware, Mr. and Mrs. Bean,
    Mr. Mrs and Miss Millston, Misses Compton, Chan-
    dler, and Hill, Messrs. Slayter, Fuller, Quaile,
    Chamier, Fooks, Willmott, and Ellwell. For Otago.—
    ...
    
There is no entry for her father, __Alfred__, although it would appear that it may have been her brother-in-law __Charles Edward Fooks__ on the voyage. As later
in the article there is a reference to ...

    ... Among the passengers we notice Mr. C. W. Fooks [sic]. Captain Fuller, returned settlers of tins province, and Mr. W. G. Fuller of the neighbouring province of Otago.

With __C. E. Fooks__ having left for Sydney on Jul 23, 1858, on the Nourmahal (LYTTELTON TIMES, VOLUME X, ISSUE 597, 24 JULY 1858).

The voyage itself appeared to have been quite arduous ...

    During the passage to Lyttelton in 1859 no less than 16 of the passengers,
    mostly children, died. The ship landed over 190. It was stated that the vessel was overcrowded.
    -- WHITE WINGS VOL I. FIFTY YEARS OF SAIL IN THE NEW ZEALAND TRADE, 1850 TO 1900

However, there is a reference to an unclaimed letter for __"Compton, Miss E J"__ at the Chief Post Office, Christcurch, for the Quarter ending December, 1864.


Alfred Compton's financial misfortune has provided some very valuable information.
Published in the _The London Gazette_, dated May 17, 1842, is an entry:

    THE COURT FOR RELIEF OF INSOLVENT
                DEBTORS.
       Saturday the 14th day of May 1842.

    ORDERS have been made, vesting in the Pro-
      visinal Assignee the Estate and Effects of the
      following Persons:

            On their own Petitions.

    .....

    Alfred Compton. Late of No. 18, South Lambeth, Surrey,
        Clerk of the Pavements of the parish of St. Mary-lebone.
        In the Debtors' Prison for London and Middlesex.

    .....

And in the _The Jurist_ for Jun 11, 1842

    INSOLVENT DEBTORS
    
    The following Prisoners are ordered to be brought before the
    Court, in Portugal-st., on Friday July 1 at 9.

    .....

    ...Alfred Compton, South Lambeth, Surrey, clerk
    to the Board of Pavement of the parish of St. Marylebone.


The _Debtor's Prisons_ were institutions where those who couldn't pay their debts where incarcerated.
These were far from pleseant if the debtor had genuinely no money, or did not have an external sponsor,
as they required to pay _board_ and would normally be released when their depbts were cleared.

Details about the prison itself, from the City of London Archives, indicates that Alred would have been
in the _Queen's Prison_ as per:

    ...The Fleet and Marshalsea Prisons were abolished from 31 May 1842 and the
    Queen’s Bench Prison, renamed the Queen’s Prison, became the only prison for all
    debtors, bankrupts and other persons who might previously have been imprisoned in
    any of the three prisons. In 1862 the Queen’s Prison closed, subsequently becoming a
    military prison. -- https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk
